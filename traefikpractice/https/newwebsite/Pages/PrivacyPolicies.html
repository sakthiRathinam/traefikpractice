                            Usage Information. Whenever you visit our application, we, as well as any third-party advertisers
and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect
information about how the application is accessed and used (“Usage Information”). Usage
Information may include browser type, device type, operating system, application version, the page
served, the time, the preceding page views, and your use of features or applications on the
application. This information helps us keep our application fresh and interesting to our visitors and
allows us to tailor content to a visitor’s interests.
Device Identifier. We automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device
Identifier”) for the Device (computer, mobile phone, tablet or other device) you use to access the
application. A Device Identifier is a number that is assigned to your Device when you access a
application or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. We may
use a Device Identifier to, among other things, administer the application, help diagnose problems
with our servers, analyze trends, track users’ web page movements, help identify you and your
interests, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
The technologies used on the application to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers,
include but are not limited to: cookies (data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the
application), mobile analytics software and pixel tags (transparent graphic image, sometimes called
a web beacon or tracking beacon, placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page
or email has been viewed). Cookies may also be used to associate you with social networking sites
if you so choose, enable interaction between your activities on the application and your activities on
such social networking sites. We, or our vendors, may place cookies or similar files on your Device
for security purposes, to facilitate site navigation, to perform analytics, and personalize your
experience while visiting our application (such as allowing us to select which ads or offers are most
likely to appeal to you, based on your interests, preferences, location, or demographic information).
A pixel tag may tell your browser to get content from another server.
To learn how you may be able to reduce the number of cookies you receive from us, or delete
cookies that have already been installed in your browser’s cookie folder, or prevent tracking
activities, please refer to your browser’s tools or help menu or other instructions related to your
browser. Because an industry-standard Do-Not-Track protocol has not yet been established, our
information collection practices on our application will continue to operate as described in this online
privacy policy regardless of any “Do Not Track” signals that may be sent by certain browsers.
However, you may refuse to accept cookies in order to prevent tracking activities. If you do disable
or opt out of receiving cookies, please be aware that some features and services on our application
may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your
account(s). In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or
tailored to your interests.
